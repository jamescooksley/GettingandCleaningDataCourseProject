Description

This codebook describes how the data, vars and transformations fit together within the code.

Source Data

A description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Data can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

The following files have been read to perform analysis:
•features.txt
•activity_labels.txt
•subject_train.txt
•x_train.txt
•y_train.txt
•subject_test.txt
•x_test.txt
•y_test.txt

All of the test and train datasets are merged together using rbind function in R.

2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Using grep I have derived all mean values and std values within the merged dataset.

3.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge data subset with the activityType table to inlude the descriptive activity names.

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
Clean up var names with the gsub function.

5.Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
A single table has been created at the end which makes use of the aggregate function to create the averages required.
